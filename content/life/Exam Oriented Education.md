title: Exam Oriented Education

*-By Abdulrahman Osman*

An education system which involves a teacher skimming over pre-determined material, valuing and disvaluing pieces of information based only on whether or not it would appear in the exam at the end of the semester is what I like to call Exam Oriented Education.

The problem with said systems is that they don't focus on making a student comprehend and understand something, they only focus on making students pass a systematically written and grouped set of questions called exams. Students start to memorize patterns of questions instead of actually understanding what they're being taught. What is considered valuable becomes what is going to be on the exam instead of what's actually intellectually valuable.

As I became aware of this honestly sad situation, I started to notice the pattern more and more in every lecture I attend. Phrases like "You're going to need this in the exam",  "I will be asking this and that", "A lot of students make mistakes in this during the exam" became inescapably annoying. We are studying the structure of the exam, not the actual material of the course. Actual deep understanding of the subject isn't a goal anymore.

Some might argue that exams are measurement devices of a person's understanding of a subject, but I find that not true at all. having someone set in a room answering multiple questions about a  topic in a small time interval isn't an actual scale of their understanding but a scale of how much they are comfortable with the environment of an exam.

Needless to say that this doesn't apply to all fields everywhere. Some teaching institutions use methods that prioritize students comprehension over getting them familiar with a specific testing patterns. And the methods for this vary a lot from field to field of course.
